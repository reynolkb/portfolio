				At Bon Accord Care, we have a specific requirement for input validation in certain fields in a
				number of our forms. Although this is not a standard feature in the Formstack for Salesforce
				App, the Pro Service team, namely Kyle Reynolds, assisted us in creating a piece of JS code to
				meet our requirement. This has helped our teams gather required information from our customers
				at form submission leading to reduced call backs and admin errors.

				The team at Formstack always offers great support and respond in a timely manner. We had a request on
				one of the forms we implemented for a client that required a SortOrder requirement build in JavaScript.
				Kyle and Professional Services team were able to build this for us and exceed our expectations! They
				will forever be a recommended partner to us.

				Kyle Reynolds went above and beyond to help us create a custom experience for our users using FormStack.
				Not only did he create this unique user experience, he also took time and care to empower our Marketing
				team, who have no experience with code, how to update and adjust for future functionality with easy to
				follow instructions. Kyleâ€™s work created a custom product that functioned the way we need and enables us
				to use it in many instances to come.
